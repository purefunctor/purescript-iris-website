# IRIS website

The website for [IRIS](https://github.com/purefunctor/purescript-iris), a modern functional programming language with effect tracking. Built with Astro, React and PureScript.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

You'll need Git, [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node.js, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), a current stable Rust toolchain, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, and `wasm-bindgen-cli` 0.2.127. fnm reads the Node version from `.node-version`; pnpm manages its own version using the `packageManager` pin. See the playground's [toolchain instructions](playground/compiler/API.md#building) for the Rust commands.

Use Git checkouts of this website and [the IRIS compiler](https://github.com/purefunctor/purescript-iris). Put the compiler at `../repos/purescript-iris`, or set `IRIS_REPOSITORY` to its path. The commands below build the native compiler from that checkout; no separate IRIS installation is needed.

**In an Amp orb:** open Website or Playground in the Portal tab. Orb preparation installs the tools and dependencies and builds the development assets; startup reuses those caches and starts the dev server. A fresh preparation takes longer than starting from a cached snapshot. See [the agent guide](AGENTS.md#orb-setup-and-preview) for lifecycle and recovery commands.

### First time

On your machine, run these from the website directory:

```sh
fnm install
fnm use
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

This builds the native compiler, browser compiler (WASM), and website components, then starts the dev server. The first build can take a while; later starts reuse caches. A production build is not required for development.

### Start developing

On your machine, run:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This prepares the playground and PureScript output, then starts the compiler watcher and Astro with live updates. You don't need to repeat dependency installation unless dependencies change. For agent-specific orb startup commands, see [the agent guide](AGENTS.md#orb-setup-and-preview).

### Production

Development and production both run on Node.js:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

`pnpm preview` runs the same production server. Set `HOST` and `PORT` to choose its listening address (defaults: `0.0.0.0:4321`). Keep `dist/`, `server.mjs`, `package.json`, and installed production dependencies together. No hosting provider or deployment command is configured.

## Playground

Open `/playground` to edit and run PureScript in your browser. Start with an example, change the code, and see the generated JavaScript and running result.

Programs run in a sandboxed frame without network access. The compiler worker downloads the pinned PureScript package archives directly from the Registry, verifies their SHA-256 hashes, and caches them in the browser. Package sources are not included in the website build. The compiler and JavaScript runtime are still bundled website assets.

The header shows package-loading progress. The Packages sidebar links to version-specific Pursuit documentation and displays the license and notice files included in each downloaded archive. Archives without those files link to the upstream repository instead.

Repeat visits reuse verified cached archives. Browser storage can be disabled or evicted; a first visit or a cache miss requires Registry access. This is not a fully offline application. Infinite loops can still freeze the browser tab.
